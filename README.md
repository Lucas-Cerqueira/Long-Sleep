# Long-Sleep
Game called "Long Sleep" created during the Ludum Dare 38 game jam. We had 3 days to create this game, 
in which we used only 2. The jam theme was "A small World" and we used it very lightly within the context of the game. 
It's a story-driven walking simulator, where you walk around, read texts logs and solve "puzzles" in order to progress. 
Oh, and there will be a timer in the game but don't worry, we pause it when you read the texts.

# Controls
- Move with "WASD"
- Look around using your mouse
- Interact using "E"
